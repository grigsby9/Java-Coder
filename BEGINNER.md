## Fraction Adder

Write a program that prompts the user for two fractions, adds them, and then displays the solution with lowest common denominator. For example, when adding 1/2 and 5/6, the result is 4/3. The user should be able to enter a fraction such as 2/9 in a single input. Utilize helper methods for obtaining the numerator and denominator of strings such as "3/4" from the user, and for computing the greatest common divisor of two integers.
